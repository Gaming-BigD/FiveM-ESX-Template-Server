## 📃 **Description**

With this Fivem resource, your players can engage in the timeless game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. One player initiates the game by sending a request to their opponent. The recipient has the choice to accept or reject the request after receiving it. If accepted, they are given a configurable time limit of 5 seconds to make their decision before being presented with the options of Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Once a decision has been taken, a custom animation will start, ultimately revealing the game's winner.
